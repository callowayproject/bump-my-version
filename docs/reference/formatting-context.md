# Formatting context

These fields are available for

- version serializing
- searching and replacing in files
- commit messages
- tag names
- tag annotations

## Escaped characters

::: field-list

    `#`
    : The literal hash or [octothorpe](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/octothorpe) character.
    
    `;`
    : The literal semicolon character.


## Date and time fields

::: field-list

    `now`
    : A Python datetime object representing the current local time, without a time zone reference.
    
    `utcnow`
    : A Python datetime object representing the current local time in the UTC time zone.

You can provide [additional formatting guidance](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) for datetime objects using formatting codes. Put the formatting codes after the field and a colon. For example, `{now:%Y-%m-%d}` would output the current local time as `2023-04-20`.

## Source code management fields

These fields will only have values if the code is in a Git or Mercurial repository.

::: field-list

    `commit_sha`
    : The latest commit reference.

    `short_commit_sha`
    : The short version of the latest commit reference.
    
    `distance_to_latest_tag`
    : The number of commits since the latest tag.
    
    `dirty`
    : A boolean indicating if the current repository has pending changes.
    
    `branch_name`
    : The current branch name.
    
    `short_branch_name`
    : The current branch name, converted to lowercase, with non-alphanumeric characters removed and truncated to 20 characters. For example, `feature/MY-long_branch-name` would become `featuremylongbranchn`.

## Version fields

::: field-list
    `current_version`
    : The current version serialized as a string
    
    `current_<version component>`
    : Each version component defined by the [version configuration parsing regular expression](configuration/global.md#parse). The default configuration would have `current_major`, `current_minor`, and `current_patch` available.
    
    `new_version`
    : The new version serialized as a string
    
    `new_<version component>`
    : Each version component defined by the [version configuration parsing regular expression](configuration/global.md#parse). The default configuration would have `new_major`, `new_minor`, and `new_patch` available.

!!! note

    The following fields are only available when serializing a version.

::: field-list
    `<version component>`
    : Each version part defined by the [version configuration parsing regular expression](configuration/global.md#parse). The default configuration would have `major`, `minor`, and `patch` available.

## Environment variables

Every environment variable available at runtime is included with a `$` prefix. For example if `USER` was in the environment, `{$USER}` would render that value.

!!! tip

    If you use environment variables in your version serialization, you might want to ensure they are set by executing `export VAR=value` before running the `bump-my-version` command.
